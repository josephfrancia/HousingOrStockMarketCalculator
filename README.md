# HousingOrStockMarketCalculator
This package compares the returns between two types of investments: a rental property and a generic financial instrument. This calculator was primarily motivated behind by my curiosity about an up-and-coming housing startup called Roofstock. Roofstock is a marketplace to buy relatively cheap homes for the purpose of renting them out. 
Intrigued by the idea of being able to own and rent out a home, I built this calculator to see how my hypothetical rental property would perform against an investment into the stock market.
